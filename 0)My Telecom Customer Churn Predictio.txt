My Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Project:
Business Problem (this goes in your README)
A telecom company wants to identify customers who are likely to churn so that proactive retention strategies can be applied.

Because it's expenisive to get new customers and it's and cheaper to keep existing customers by offering discounts, improve service, Call the customer, retain revenue.

THIS IS A REAL BUSINESS PROBLEM.

CHURN = LOSE MONEY.

What recruiters will LOVE about this project: “I built an end-to-end churn prediction system.
I cleaned raw telecom data, engineered features, trained and evaluated multiple models, handled class imbalance, and deployed the final pipeline as a FastAPI service.”

Why handling class imbalance is so ***IMP***:
Handling class imbalance in a Data Science/Machine Learning (DS/ML) customer churn prediction project means implementing specific techniques to prevent the machine learning model from becoming biased towards the majority class (active/loyal customers) and ignoring the minority class (those who churn). 
In most real-world scenarios, the number of customers who churn is far smaller (e.g., 5-10%) than those who stay, creating an imbalanced dataset. Without handling this, a model could achieve 90% accuracy simply by predicting that no one will ever churn, which defeats the purpose of the project.

Think of this project as 3 layers:
1️⃣ Data Science – understand why customers churn
2️⃣ Machine Learning – predict who will churn
3️⃣ Engineering – make the model usable (API)
